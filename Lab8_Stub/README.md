CS-546 Lab 8
Template Time
For this lab, you will create a Ticketmaster API application that will be using HTML, CSS, and Handlebars to make your first simple templated web application!

You will not need to use a database for this lab.

You must use the async/await keywords. You will also be using axios (Links to an external site.), which is a HTTP client for Node.js; you can install it with npm i axios.

Your application will be making Axios calls to the Ticketmaster API for data.

You will be utilizing the Ticket Master Discovery APILinks to an external site. for data.

The base URL is https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/

You will have to register a free account and get your own individual API key. After receiving the api key, you would insert the key into the url that you requested with axios.

In addition, when querying venues for any of your routes, you should filter the data to only be results found in the US. You can do this with the ‘countryCode’ url param.

So for example, if you were querying all venues, the url should be

https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/venues?apikey=${API_KEY}&countryCode=US

The full authorization documentation can be found hereLinks to an external site.

You can play with the API and different parameters hereLinks to an external site.

You will be using the following endpoints from the API:

The endpoint to search venues:

https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/venues?keyword=${searchVenueTerm}&apikey=${API_KEY_HERE}&countryCode=US

The endpoint for a single venue by id:

https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/venues/VENUE_ID_HERE?&apikey=${API_KEY_HERE}&countryCode=US

YOU MUST use the directory and file structure in the code stub or points will be deducted. You can download the starter template here: Lab8_Stub.zipDownload Lab8_Stub.zip

PLEASE NOTE: THE STUB DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PACKAGE.JSON FILE. YOU WILL NEED TO CREATE IT! DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER FILE OR FOLDER APART FROM PACKAGE.JSON FILE. DO NOT FORGET THE START COMMAND OR THE "type": "module" property

You will be making three pages/routes in your application:

http://localhost:3000/ the main page/route of this application will provide a search form to start a search of the API.
http://localhost:3000/searchvenues this page/route will search through the API using a keyword search (see the API documentation) and return up to 10 matching results, the keyword comes from the provided request form param, searchVenueTerm
http://localhost:3000/venuedetails/:id this page/route will show all the details of the venue with the id matching the provided URL param, id
All other URLS should return a 404

GET http://localhost:3000/
This page will respond with a valid HTML document. The title of the document should be "Venue Finder". You should have the title set as the <title> element of the HTML document and as an h1 in your document.

Your page should reference a CSS file, /public/css/main-styles.css; this file should have at least 5 rulesets that apply to this page; these 5 rules can also apply to elements across all of your pages, or be unique to this page.

You should have a main element, and inside of the main element have a p element with a brief (2-3 sentence description) of what your website does.

Also inside the main element, you will have a form; this form will POST to the /searchvenues route. This form will have an input and a label; the label should properly reference the same id as the input using the for attribute. You should also have an input with a type of submit that submits the form. The input in your form should have a name of searchVenueTerm.

POST http://localhost:3000/searchvenues
This page will respond with a valid HTML document. The title of the document should be "Venues Found". You should have the title set as the <title> element of the HTML document and as an h1 in your document. In an h2 element, you will print the supplied searchVenueTerm.

Your page should reference a CSS file, /public/css/main-styles.css; this file should have at least 5 rulesets that apply to this page; these 5 rules can also apply to elements on /, or be unique to this page.

You should have a main element, and inside of the main element have a ol tag that has a list of up to 10 venues (the first 10 that appear in the search result array) matching the searchVenueTerm found in the request body in the following format (after searching Madison).

<ol>
   <li>
      <a href="/venuedetails/KovZpZA7AAEA">Madison Square Garden</a> </li> 
 <li> 
 <a href="/venuedetails/KovZpZAa1anA">Madison Theatre</a> 
 </li> 
 <li> 
 <a href="/venuedetails/KovZpZAE7EAA">Madison Live!</a> 
 </li> 
 <li> 
 <a href="/venuedetails/KovZ917APhp">Madison Center for the Arts</a> 
 </li> 
 <li> 
 <a href="/venuedetails/KovZpZA7kvlA">The Theatre at MSG</a> 
 </li> 
 <li> 
 <a href="/venuedetails/KovZpabkQe">Madison Theatre</a> 
 </li> 
 <li> 
 <a href="/venuedetails/KovZ917AtKH">Madison County Fairgrounds</a> 
 </li>
<li> 
<a href="/venuedetails/KovZpZAE6lvA">Madison Street Theatre</a> 
</li>
<li> 
<a href="/venuedetails/KovZpZAIIIkA">Madison Square Park</a> 
</li>
<li> 
<a href="/venuedetails/Z1lMVSyiJynZad9jvPa7vo">madison square garden</a> 
</li>
</ol>
You must also provide an a tag that links back to your / route with the text Make another search.

If no matches are found, you will print the following HTML paragraph:

<p class="not-found">We're sorry, but no results were found for {{searchVenueTerm}}.</p>
If the user does not input text into their form, make sure to give a response status code of 400 on the page, and render an HTML page with a paragraph class called error; this paragraph should describe the error.

GET http://localhost:3000/venuedetails/:id
This page will respond with a valid HTML document. The title of the document should be "Venue Details". You should have the title set as the <title> element of the HTML document and as an h1 in your document inside a header element .

Your page should reference a CSS file, /public/css/main-styles.css; this file should have at least 5 rulesets that apply to this page; these 5 rules can also apply to elements on /, or be unique to this page.

You should have a main element, and inside of the main element have a div tag, inside the div tag you have the following children elements: In an h2 element, you will display the name of the venue, an img element that contains the image of the venue, you will set the source of the img to be the url for the venue image contained in the data(shown below in the images array) and set the alt attribute to the venue name (as shown below in sample HTML), an a element that will link to the venue's website in a new tab with the text "Venue Information on Ticketmaster", an address element that contains the text "Address:" and then display the address, the city, state, and postal code for that venue (in the data, these are the address.line1, city.name, state.stateCode and postalCode fields), and finally another address element that contains the text "Phone:" and then display the venue's phone number field (boxOfficeInfo.phoneNumberDetail field in the data). IF ANY OF THIS DATA IS MISSING FROM THE API, YOU WILL DISPLAY "N/A" FOR THE FIELDS THAT DO NOT HAVE DATA, IF THERE IS NO IMAGE FOR A VENUE, USE A "NO PHOTO" DEFAULT IMAGE (I have supplied one in the /public/images directory in the code stub)

If the request to the Ticketmaster API using :id responds with an error, make sure to give a response status code of 404 on the page, and render an HTML page with a paragraph class called error; this paragraph should describe the error (a venue with that id does not exist). For example: https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/venues/101?&apikey=${API_KEY}&countryCode=USLinks to an external site.  responds with an error because it does not exist, so you would respond with a 404 and a message stating that.

http://localhost:3000/public/css/main-styles.css
This file should have 5 rulesets that apply to the / route, and 5 rulesets that apply to all of your pages. Rulesets may be shared across both pages; for example, if you styled a p tag, it would count as 1 of the 5 for both pages.

You may include more than 5 rulesets if you so desire.

References and Packages
Basic CSS info can easily be referenced in the MDN CSS tutorialLinks to an external site..

Hints
You can use variables in your handlebars layout, that you pass to res.render. For example, in your layout you could have:

<meta name="keywords" content="{{keywords}}" />
And in your route:

res.render("someView", {keywords: "dogs coffee keto"});
Which will render as:

<meta name="keywords" content="dogs coffee keto" />
Or, perhaps, the title tag.

Requirements
You must not submit your node_modules folder
You must remember to save your dependencies to your package.json folder
You must do basic error checking in each function
Check for arguments existing and of proper type.
Throw if anything is out of bounds (ie, trying to perform an incalculable math operation or accessing data that does not exist)
If a function should return a promise, instead of throwing you should return a rejected promise.
You must remember to update your package.json file to set app.js as your starting script!
Your HTML must be validLinks to an external site. or you will lose points on the assignment.
Your HTML must make semantical sense; usage of tags for the purpose of simply changing the style of elements (such as i, b, font, center, etc) will result in points being deducted; think in terms of content first, then style with your CSS.
You can be as creative as you'd like to fulfill front-end requirements; if an implementation is not explicitly stated, however you go about it is fine (provided the HTML is valid and semantical). Design is not a factor in this course.
All inputs must be properly labeled!
All previous requirements about the package.json author, start task, dependenices, etc. still apply
